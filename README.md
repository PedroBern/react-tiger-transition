Page transitions for [react router dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). Animate your routes programmatically during navigation. Instead of defining the animation inside `<Route />`, this module defines inside `<Link />`, allowing to easily reach and leave the same url with different transitions.
